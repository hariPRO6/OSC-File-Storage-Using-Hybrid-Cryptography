## 🔍 Overview
**Secure Safe** is a web-based application designed for secure file storage and transfer. It employs advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user data. By utilizing a hybrid encryption approach, Secure Safe allows users to upload, store, and download files securely.

# ✨ Features
- 🔒 **Hybrid Cryptography**: Combines symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods for enhanced security.
- 🛡️ **Multi-Layered Encryption**: Files are segmented and encrypted using different algorithms (e.g., AES, ChaCha20).
- 🔑 **Secure Key Management**: Unique keys are generated and securely stored for each file segment.
- 🌐 **User -Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for easy file upload and download.
- ✅ **Data Integrity**: Ensures that files remain unchanged during transfer.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: React, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Cryptography**: Cryptography Library (e.g., PyCryptodome)
